Simple script to track an object in a video. 
HOW TO USE:
1. Change the path for your video in the Python script (tracking_objects.py);
2. run the python script tracking_objects.py;
3. indicate number of object you want to track;
4. select the objects. 

Example of output:
<img src="rbltro.gif" width="354" height="200">

The algorithm is very basic and not always robust. If you have any suggestions on
how to improve the robustness, they are very welcome.
