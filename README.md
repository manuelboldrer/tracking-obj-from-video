Simple script to track an object in a video. 
1. Change the path for your video in the python script.
2. run the python script
3. indicate number of object you want to track
4. select the objects

   Example of output:
<img src="rbltro.gif" width="354" height="200">

The algorithm is very basic and not very robust. 
If you have any suggestions on how to improve the robustness, they are very welcome :)
